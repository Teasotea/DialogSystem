# *Conversational Bot, which can answer your Data Science interview questions :)*
Dialog System, that performs classification, Question Answering, and Natural Language Generation tasks

## Task
The task was to create a bot, which would welcome the user only if he or she sends the greetings first. The bot should tell the right answers for Data Science interview Questions if they exist in the Database. Otherwise, the bot should generate answers with the help of NLG techniques. If the user wants to stop the conversation, the bot should classify that intention and say 'See you soon! Bye!'
